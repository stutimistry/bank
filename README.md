This project is a simple Bank Loan Application Form designed using HTML and CSS. The form allows users to input details like their name, email, PAN number, desired loan amount, and loan tenure. It also includes a feature to calculate the Estimated EMI, though the calculation logic would need to be implemented in JavaScript.
